# Smart-Water-Quality-System
Course Project 1

Designed and implemented an IoT system using ESP32 to monitor water quality in Basa fish farming, with real-time measurement and tracking of pH, turbidity, and temperature. Sensor data is collected and sent to Firebase Realtime Database, then visualized through an OLED display and a mobile application.
